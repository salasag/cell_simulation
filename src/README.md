Andreas Santos, Jack Bloomfeld, Alex Salas

Started: Thursday February 2, 2017
Finished: Monday February 13, 2017

Estimated number of hours working: 50hrs/person (150hrs total)

Each Person's Role:

* Everyone helped out with all aspects of the project (in terms of design, ideas, debugging, etc), but for the most part:
	* Jack- XML
	* Alex- GUI
	* Andreas- Rules implementation

We used sources provided on CS308 webpage, Java documentation, and Stack Overflow to help debug small issues.

FILE USED TO RUN PROJECT: SplashScreen.java
Data and Resource Files used: XML files in Data folder, English.properties in resources package

Other information:

* Don't forget that clicking on cells on the grid will change their state
	* Note that for certain simulations (esp. WaTor), changing the current state of a cell by clicking on it will change it's state, but not other certain attributes of it, which means these cells will not necessarily behave as expected.
* The only simulation that has a class but doesn't work is the Langton Loop simulation.
